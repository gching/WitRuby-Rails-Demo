# WitRuby Rails Demo

Made to demonstrate capabilities Wit.AI and the WitRuby gem with Rails.

Given a typed message, Wit.AI deciphers the intent and responds accordingly.

Huge props to the wizards at Wit.AI for making this natural language interface. Go thank them here on twitter:

This was more of a learning experience for me and definitely the code is smelly for the gem, so please contribute and help me make this gem as best it can be!
